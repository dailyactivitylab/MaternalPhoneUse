 		- ITS outputs from LENA recordings
   	Sleep_movi_infants
 		- Sleep episodes identified using Sadeh sleep algorithm


Date_Binned: folder contains 1-minute binned timeseries outputs from ITSbin.R and beiwe_lena_preprocessing.R (Part 1); used for part 2 of beiwe_lena_preprocessing.R
      		
	Beiwe_binned_infants
 		- P##.csv for each participant: phone state (on or off) for every minute of participant's Beiwe recording
	LENA_binned_infants
 		- P## folder for each participant: contains outputs from ITSbin.R
   			- 1mins_midnight_CRTRUE_seq_alldata folder contains csv files with 1-minute binned word counts
      

Data_Ready_for_Analysis: folder contains outputs from beiwe_lena_preprocessing.R (part 2); used for beiwe_lena_analysis.R

	P##.csv for each participant
		- files containing 1-minute binned Beiwe and LENA (infant sleep removed) data for each participant
	all_P.csv
 		- one file containing 1-minute binned Beiwe and LENA (infant sleep removed) data for all participants
